# Final-Year-Project
This repository contains the code used for my MEng Final Year Project which was utilizing a deep CNN in the automatic reconstruction 
of a cross cut shredded document. This was my first attempt at coding a project in python or any project of this size.

This repository doesn't contain the two trained CNNs required to run the code, as well as, sample shreds to reconstruct with associated
csv of there shred ids.
If you want to look at these please feel free to contact me directly.
